The first idea I had was for every line that doesn't have 1s, save it as a single bit boolean where false is there are no 1s and true means there are ones. The next idea I had was saving the position of the first 1s and also counting how many 1s are in a single line. However, I believe this will case it to take more space because an int is 32 bits and I think will be too big if were were saving the number of 1s in each line. |

I wrote the example bitmaps with the smiley face and tried to think of ideas on how to approach this. My idea was to go through the bit map 8 bits at a time and look for if there is any 1's. If there is a 1, we will leave the 8bits alone. However, if there is no 1's, we can just write a single 0. I attempted to code this but I need to write code that fixes the out bounds error we could get if the total number of bits isn't a multiple of 8. Additionally, I am not sure how the expand would work because there is nothing helping us know if the 0 is actually 0 8 bits or if the next 8 bits are just  the normal 8 bits that were unchanged. |

Therefore, I created a while loop that goes through the String that is read. I check each char in the string, checking if it is 0 or something else. If it is 0, it means there is 8 bits of 0's and therefore I write 1 0 into my compressed file. Otherwise, I will write the char which will turn binary into my compressed file. |
| November 19 |   7:30-8:00   | I read through the notes from Sedgewick and saw we need to counter the number of 0's until we reach a 1. We will write the number of 0's we encountered and begin counting the 1s and repeat. I wrote down some pseudocode from the notes to help me code this. I wasn't really sure how I would read a single bit, so I just used the read boolean function to help with that. I wrote down some code below the pseudocode I wrote down as well. I basically understand what I am supposed to do. However, what I am really confused is how do we know how many times we need to count (like the length so I could use a for loop). Additionally, I am confused on how to know we switch to the next row of bits because Sedgewick says to write a 0 if the last bit from the last row and the first bit from the new row are the same and we reach the "maximum," then we write 0 and reset count. My confusion is on how do we know we reach the maximum since we don't know the length of the row. |

I just used a while loop to do this until the file is empty. Additionally, I made it so that the function starts withs assuming that we start with 0 rather than checking what the first bit is (if a 1 or 0). Additionally, I wrote the expand function so that it goes through the file, reads byte by byte, and writes down the number of 0's and 1's. |

I found that my functions did not work at all. I used the dumpbinary class to help me find what is wrong. I saw that my compression wasn't compressing correctly. I looked over my compressed function and saw that I wrote a whole integer instead of a byte, which was causing my error. Additionally, I ran the functions again and saw that I lost information. I realized that I just needed to write counter 1 more time after the while loop and it fixed that bug. Finished this problem set. |
