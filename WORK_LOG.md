The first idea I had was for every line that doesn't have 1s, save it as a single bit boolean where false is there are no 1s and true means there are ones. The next idea I had was saving the position of the first 1s and also counting how many 1s are in a single line. However, I believe this will case it to take more space because an int is 32 bits and I think will be too big if were were saving the number of 1s in each line. |
| November 18 | 10:45 - 11:45 | I spent most of this time working on a physical piece of paper. I wrote the example bitmaps with the smiley face and tried to think of ideas on how to approach this. My idea was to go through the bit map 8 bits at a time and look for if there is any 1's. If there is a 1, we will leave the 8bits alone. However, if there is no 1's, we can just write a single 0. I attempted to code this but I need to write code that fixes the out bounds error we could get if the total number of bits isn't a multiple of 8. Additionally, I am not sure how the expand would work because there is nothing helping us know if the 0 is actually 0 8 bits or if the next 8 bits are just  the normal 8 bits that were unchanged. |

Therefore, I created a while loop that goes through the String that is read. I check each char in the string, checking if it is 0 or something else. If it is 0, it means there is 8 bits of 0's and therefore I write 1 0 into my compressed file. Otherwise, I will write the char which will turn binary into my compressed file. |
